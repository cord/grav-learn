![Grav Admin Plugins](plugins.png) 

The **Plugins** in the admin is a powerful text editor and page manager that enables you to create your page's content (including media files), its publishing and taxonomy options, settings, overrides, and theme-specific options.

It's essentially a one-stop-shop for managing a specific page.

In this page, we will go over the features and functionality found in the **Advanced** tab of the **Plugins**. 

>>>>> You might notice the check boxes to the left of some of the options in this area of the admin. These boxes indicate that you would like to override the default values for this page. Leaving them unchecked reverts to blank or default states.

The <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Add button takes you to a page listing all of the currently-available Grav plugins, enabling you to view their information and install them by selecting the <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Install button to the right of the plugin.

The <span color="purple"><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i></span> icon indicates that the plugin is created and supported by the Grav team. Plugins without this icon were created by third-party developers.
